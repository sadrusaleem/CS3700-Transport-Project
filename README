Essentially, we just tried to implement TCP as presented in the slides. We
used a cwnd with AIMD and used selective acking. The sender would keep all 
packets that had not been acked yet so that it would be able to retransmit on 
RTO. Similarly, the receiver keeps track of packets it receives that are out of order and prints them in sequence when appropriate.

Obviously, the challenging parts were dealing with high drop rates and retransmitting efficiently. Also, the EOF was an interesting case to solve. We ended
up using an aggresive approach of sending multiple ack's to the EOF because
there really is no way to ensure delivery.

Testing was basically using the test script and debug statements. Seeing where the test
script failed and then using the run script to see the logs and go from there.
